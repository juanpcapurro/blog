Other developers and myself have been noticing that the solhint repo hasn't been getting much care
these past few years. The last commit to the master branch is from three months ago, the last
development cycle didn't yield too many features, and there are `plenty of good PRs ready for review
or merging which aren't getting any attention <https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pulls>`_.

I have been noticing some frustration with these issues by the solidity community at large, so I
decided to fork the project.

I of course didn't make this alone, it's a fork after all, and I have to thank mainly `fvictorio
<https://github.com/fvictorio/>`_ for his mentoring, `drake evans
<https://github.com/DrakeEvans>`_ for pushing me to start the fork, and the Protofire team and the
solidity community at large for their hard work so far.

So, this is what I've made:

- `npm package <https://www.npmjs.com/package/solhint-community>`_
- `github repo <https://github.com/solhint-community/solhint-community>`_
- `documentation page <https://solhint-community.github.io/solhint-community>`_

Regarding releases:

- ``3.4.1`` has feature parity with the last release of legacy solhint
- ``3.5.0`` includes the no-empty-blocks update by hackartists, and no-unused-import by myself

Happy lintin'
