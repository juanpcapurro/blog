Now both the content on this blog and `my sewing patterns
<https://github.com/juanpcapurro/sewing>`_ are licensed under a CC-BY-SA
*libre* license.

This means anyone can share them, and make derivative works based on them as
long as they make an attribution (BY) and share it under a compatible license
(SA).

I care mostly about the latter, but it seems that there's no such thing as a
CC-SA license.

Did I nail all the legal points correctly? Probably not.

Does this ultimately matter? No, if someone wants to make a derivative work
without giving attribution or sharing it under a similar license it's possible
that I won't notice, that I won't care enough to or know how to prosecute them.

Also I'm not sure if I'm behind the idea of having a legal framework to enforce
what can be shared and how, and I'm always going to regard those living outside
of it as aesthetically superior. But I don't want those still constrained by it
to use it to restrict the naturally-free-flowing stream of handlebar bag
designs.

Soon I'll also go through my software repos to make sure that all of them are
under a GPL-something license. And perhaps write on what was the event that
red-pilled me into not using a MIT/BSD license ever again.
