:summary: The subtitle changes. That's pretty much it.

Now the site has various subtitles which are randomly picked for each page.

The random algorithm isn't seeded with the post's title or anything so they'll change every time I rebuild the articles. This might create some unnecessary html downloads since the last-modified date will change and browsers won't use the cached pages. But I make small html pages so I won't lose too much sleep over it.

You'll have to see the different posts to see all the new subtitles. Or you can cheat and look at the source code. I won't judge you.

I probably should stop procrastinating and make a contact page already, but please email, telegram, tweet or add as a pull request your ideas/suggestions âœ¨
