The title pretty much sums it up. Conditions are:

- Send me a plaintext  email with what you want me to research.
- I might reply asking for clarifications but please try to include all
  relevant context in the first message.
- No price discussion or anything like that, I'm not a trader.
- I'm budgeting 15 hours total, and researching for 3-5 different people.
- Only permissionless & decentralized stuff.

Ideal questions are of the form 'Can I use X in Y way to achive Z?' and mostly
technical. More open-ended questions are allowed, but might be hard to find a
succint answer that makes you happy in a reasonable timeframe.

I have the most expertise with Ethereum but I'm also familiar with Monero and
Bitcoin technicalities.

Hell, if you're a sneaky enough dev, you might even be able to delegate a task
to me and take an afternoon off.

Anyway, send your inquiries to hi at capu dot tech, I'm looking forward to
helping you out!
