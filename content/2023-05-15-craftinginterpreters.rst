:summary: `crafting interpreters <https://craftinginterpreters.com/>`_ is one hell of a book

A few months ago I skimmed the first few chapters of `crafting interpreters
<https://craftinginterpreters.com/>`_ in order to have a bit of the theoretical
background required to build `some solhint rules
<https://github.com/protofire/solhint/pull/417>`_, and found out it's a great
resource.

Although I've programmed profesionally for the last six years, I kind of feel myself wanting to
'actually learn to code'.

I want to feel more confident in my ability to harness big, complex problems with abstractions of my
own creation, and further specialize into my core skill: being the Dude Who More Or Less Knows How
Computers Work.

On a high level view, I'm thinking I want to do two things:

- Improve my **ability**, that is, the amount of complexity my mind (and my code) can grasp. This is
  my objective with this book.
- Improve my code's **correctness**. Given that I've been working with smart contracts for a long
  time, I'm not lacking too much on this regard. But I want to feel more confident regardless, and
  have a few more tools in my toolbelt and be faster at getting the guarantees that I want. For this
  I plan on doing rust's  programmers' manual.

The book is pretty good. It's exactly what I want, it doesn't get too far explaining theory before
getting it down into Java code, and its teaching style is super easy to follow.

I'm currently in chapter 6, you can see my lox implementation alongside my answer to challenges in
the `repo <https://github.com/juanpcapurro/craftinginterpreters>`_ I've created for that.

I know `Bru <http://deftlynot.me/>`_ is going to join me soon, and you're of course welcome to reach
out with questions, suggestions, feedback on my solutions, or whatever you see fit.

I have no deadline for getting through it, but I've been getting one chapter in every week, roughly,
and I intend to continue on the same trend.
